        Under our project theprivilegetalk; by the means of plays, skits, dances
        and art activities, our team aims to advocate for the rights of animal
        people in the background of prejudicial behavior called speciesism that
        enables the wide spread practice of the ownership and  commercial
        exploitation of animal people for human consumption. This project is
        meant to also raise social consciousness about the importance of making
        sustainable and ethical consumer choices to combat the increasingly
        uncontrollable degradation of the environment caused by anthropocentric
        activities. We wish to inculcate an ethic of care and to be a catalyst
        in transforming the minds of children to work towards a sustainable,
        accommodating world and to reject oppressive and limiting beliefs about
        oppression.

        The Liberation League organised an animal rights workshop at SOS
        Children's Village Pune for a group of 40 children.

        A skit was performed by the volunteers of the Liberation League, and a
        Poster Making Activity was organised for the students to express their
        views on animal rights and building a peaceful, sustainable world for
        all. 

        We are extremely happy to announce that we received a great response
        from all the students, who vowed to speak up against the worldwide
        exploitation of non-human persons.
